# Gigs

Welcome to gigs! The CLI gem where you can find out if your favorite artist, or any artist, is touring or not.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gigs'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or you can install this gem via ```gem install gigs``` on a command line. The ```gigs``` CLI will be installed and you can run ```gigs``` to get a list of any artist, band or DJ's touring schedule. 

## Usage
Run: ```gigs``` after installing gem.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
