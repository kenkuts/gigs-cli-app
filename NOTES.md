RUBY CLI Project:

- Create a CLI project that scrapes websites for information in where bands/artists/DJs are playing. This application will show a list of venues, dates and times to where these performers are touring.(The website used will be bigstub.com). CLI should function as follows:
    - Asks the user for a band that they are into.
    - Once the program accepts an input it should integrate that into the website string where it will search for the specific band. That website string is where we will scrape our information.
    - Information is displayed.
    - User can exit program by typing ‘exit’ then press enter. 

- Create the CLI project using OO. There should be a class for each important attribute for the concert.  Classes are as follows:
    - Concert: list of all the artists
    - Venue: list of all the venues
    - Dates: list of dates to when the concerts are taking place
